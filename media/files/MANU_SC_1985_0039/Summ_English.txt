### Case name: Bombay High Court and Supreme Court Judgments on Right to Life and Livelihood
### Case Type: Constitutional Law, Right to Life, and Livelihood
### Arguments by Plaintiff:
- The eviction of slum dwellers and pavement dwellers leads to deprivation of employment, livelihood, and therefore, to their right to life.
- Economic compulsions force these persons to live in slums or on pavements, imparting a character of a fundamental right to their occupation.
- Characterizing pavement dwellers as trespassers is constitutionally impermissible due to economic compulsions.
- The State is under an obligation to provide citizens with necessities of life and the courts have the power to issue orders directing the State to promote and protect the right to live.
### Arguments by Defendant:
- The pavements or footpaths are public properties intended to serve the convenience of the public.
- Pedestrians have a right of passage and access over pavements or footpaths.
- The claim of pavement-dwellers to put up constructions on the pavements cannot be preferred to the right of pedestrians to use the pavements for the purpose of passage and repassage.
- Pavement-dwellers have no right to use public property for a private purpose without the requisite authorization.
### Case: 
- The case revolves around the eviction of slum dwellers and pavement dwellers in Mumbai by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and the State of Maharashtra.
- The petitioners challenge the eviction orders passed by the BMC and the State of Maharashtra.
