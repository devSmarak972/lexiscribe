### Case name: Bombay High Court and Supreme Court Judgments on Right to Life and Livelihood
### Case Type: Constitutional Law, Right to Life, and Livelihood
### Arguments by Plaintiff:
- The eviction of slum dwellers and pavement dwellers leads to deprivation of employment, livelihood, and therefore, to their right to life.
- Economic compulsions force these persons to live in slums or on pavements, imparting a character of a fundamental right to their occupation.
- Characterizing pavement dwellers as trespassers is constitutionally impermissible due to economic compulsions.

### Arguments by Defendant:
- The pavements or footpaths are public properties intended to serve the convenience of the public.
- Pedestrians have a right of passage and access over pavements or footpaths.
- The claim of pavement-dwellers to put up constructions on the pavements cannot be preferred to the right of pedestrians to use the pavements for the purpose of passage and repassage.
- Pavement-dwellers have no right to use public property for a private purpose without the requisite authorization.
