### Case:

### Summary: 
The Supreme Court held that a State Legislative Assembly can be dissolved by the Governor under Article 174(2)(b) of the Constitution even before its first meeting takes place. The Court also observed that the Governor is not expected to be a mere rubber stamp of the Council of Ministers and must exercise his discretion to ensure that the government functions in accordance with the Constitution.
### Main Arguments: 
The main arguments of the case were centered around the role of the Governor in the governance of the State and the limits of his powers under Article 174(2)(b) of the Constitution. The petitioners argued that the Governor exceeded his powers by dissolving the Legislative Assembly without following the proper procedures, while the respondents argued that the dissolution was necessary to prevent a constitutional crisis.
### Court Decisions: 
The Supreme Court held that the Governor's decision to dissolve the Bihar Legislative Assembly in 2005 was wholly illegal and unconstitutional as it was based on extraneous and irrelevant considerations. The Court also observed that the Governor's immunity under Article 361 of the Constitution does not mean that the grounds of mala fides or being ultra vires will not be examined by the Court.
### Legal Precedents or Statutes Cited: 
The Supreme Court relied on several legal precedents and statutes, including Article 174(2)(b), Article 356, Article 74(1), Article 74(2), and Article 361 of the Constitution of India.
### Quotations from the court: 
The Supreme Court observed that "the Governor is not expected to be a rubber stamp of the council of ministers. The Governor is not expected to be a mere post office. The Governor is expected to be a sentinel of the Constitution. The Governor is expected to be the guardian of the Constitution." (emphasis added)
### Judgement: 
The Supreme Court held that the Governor's decision to dissolve the Bihar Legislative Assembly in 2005 was illegal and unconstitutional. The Court also observed that the Governor's powers under Article 174(2)(b) of the Constitution can be exercised even before the first meeting of the Legislative Assembly takes place.
### Conclusion: 
The Supreme Court's judgment in the Bihar Legislative Assembly Dissolution Case has significant implications for the governance of the State and the role of the Governor in ensuring that the government functions in accordance with the Constitution. The Court's decision emphasizes the importance of the Governor exercising his discretion to prevent a constitutional crisis and to ensure that the government functions in a legitimate manner.
