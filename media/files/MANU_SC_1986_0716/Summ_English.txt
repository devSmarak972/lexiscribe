### Case name: K.P. Joseph v. State of Kerala & Ors.
### Case Type: Civil Writ Petition
### Arguments by Plaintiff:
The petitioners, represented by Advocate K.P. Joseph, argued that the rules governing intestate succession in the State of Kerala discriminated against women by providing unequal shares of property to daughters and widows compared to sons. They contended that these rules were violative of Article 14 of the Constitution and hence unconstitutional and void.
### Arguments by Defendant:
The respondents, represented by Advocate K.V. Prasad, argued that Section 29(2) of the Indian Succession Act, 1951, deemed the Indian Succession Act to have adopted all laws relating to intestate succession, including the Travancore Christian Act, 1925, for Indian Christians. They contended that the Travancore Christian Act was still applicable.
### Case: 
The petitioners challenged the rules governing intestate succession in the State of Kerala, which provided unequal shares of property to daughters and widows compared to sons. They also challenged Sections 24, 28, and 29 of the Travancore Christian Act, 1925.
### Summary: 
The court held that on the coming into force of the Part-B States (Law) Act, 1951, the Travancore Christian Act, 1925, stood repealed, and Chapter II of Part V of the Indian Succession Act became applicable. The court declared that intestate succession to property of Indian Christians is governed by the provisions contained in Chapter II of Part V of the Indian Succession Act.
