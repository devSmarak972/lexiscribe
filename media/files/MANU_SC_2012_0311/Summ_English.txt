### Arguments by Defendant:
**The Unaided Private Schools** argued that the Right to Education Act, 2009, should not be applicable to them as it would infringe upon their fundamental rights under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India, which guarantees the right to profession or trade.
### Case: 
**The case revolves around the constitutional validity of Section 12(1)(c) of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 (RTE Act), which mandates private unaided schools to reserve 25% of their seats for children belonging to weaker sections and disadvantaged groups in the neighbourhood.**
